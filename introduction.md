After finishing w0 assignment, I realized that I was a fish compared with other peers. There will be a lot of obstacles in front of me. Therefore,  instead of learning from my own mistakes, I have to read from articles written by other excellent peers understanding logic before python programing and thoughts of solving each assignment.

On the road to Python with companions of Py103, I will set up two relative goals keeping me move forward:

The first goal is to finish each task assigned by Py103 TA with quality, efficiency and punctuality.

The second goals is to try to learn from @Wangjunyu and @大猫， and to do my best to catch up with them.
