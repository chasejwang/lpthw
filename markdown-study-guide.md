### Description

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tools using a tool by the same name.

Markdown is often used to format read files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, such and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

So being familiar with it and getting used to Markdown in writing and editing on Githut and Gitbook are necessary for me.
